A basic "Advertorial" responsive landing page template.

##Content Needs / Considerations##

1. Replace "SMALL TITLE HERE" with company or publication name or logo.
2. Replace the main "DOCTORS AGREE..." headline text with actual headline.
3. Replace the "Really Who..." subheadline with actual sub headline. Or delete it if you really want. But sub headline helps add validity.
4. Replace the URLs in the Share source code with actual URLs of the live version of the page.
5. Make sure the OG OpenGraph meta tags are set up correctly so that when you share the page, it pulls in the right info.
6. Replace the Author Image that is currently a cat, with a real picture.
7. Replace the Author "Person Name" and "-Job Title" with real Name and actual Job Title.
8. Replace the Lorem Ipsum paragraphs with actual Advertorial copy.
9. Replace or remove the optional banner(s) in the content area.
10. Replace the "Call to Action Here" text and URL to link to the actual next step in any funnel.
11. Update the Copyright info?
12. Replace `GTM-#####` container code with actual GTM container ID. Or delete that chunk altogether.
13. and then?
