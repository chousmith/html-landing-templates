#HTML Landing Templates#

Based off the `yo ninthlink` generator practices, these are some highly optimized static HTML landing page templates to use as starting points.

Copy the templates found in the /app directory as needed, and gulp using the `yo ninthlink` gulp process to build in to optimized dist versions.

Or something.
